# MyML Journal
A ML Newbie's journey. Just heard about ML during my junior year in high school: 
1. Did a small project in my AP Stats class, covering Stat and ML. May, 2017.
2. Finished Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course on Coursera. Getting some basics for ML. Nov, 2017.
3. Taking Andrew's Deeplearning.AI specialization, just finished my first NN implementation using only numpy. Jan 2018.
4. Adopted the more modular Numpy NN design from the "Introduction to Deep Learning" by NRUHSE, checked in init version. Jan 2018. 
5. While my previous fullly connected NN struggled to improve over through 98% for MNIST, my simple CNN (2Conv + 2FC) using CNN with Keras effortlessly went beyond 99% for MNIST data set. Jan 2018.
6. Picked up Data Augment technic from Yassine Ghouzam's Kaggle post. The augmentation pushed the MNIST test accuracy to 99.45% even for the simple 2Conv+2FC network. Jan 2018.
