# MyML Journal
A ML Newbie's journey. Just heard about ML at second semester of my junior high school year. Here we go: 
1. Done a small project on my AP Stat, covering Stat and ML. May, 2017.
2. Finished Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning". Getting some basics for ML, still hungry for more. Nov, 2017.
3. Taking Andrew's Deeplearning.AI specialization, just finished my first NN implementation using only numpy. Jan 2018.
4. Adopted the more modular Numpy NN design from the "Introduction to Deep Learning" by NRUHSE, checked in init version. Jan 2018. 
5. While my previous fullly connected NN struggled to improve over through 98% for MNIST, my simple CNN (2Conv + 2FC) using Keras easily went beyond 99%. Keras rocks. Jan 2018.
